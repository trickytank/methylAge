\usage{
phenoage(
  x,
  id_col = "ID",
  age_col = "phenoage",
  allow_missing = getOption("methylAge.allow_missing"),

\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix of methylation proportions, with probes/markers as named rows and samples as named columns.}

\item{id_col}{Name of the sample ID in the output tibble.}

\item{age_col}{Name of the estimated age column in the output tibble.}

\item{allow_missing}{If FALSE, then all markers in `coef` must be present in `x.`}

\item{dim_warning}{If TRUE, then a warning is raised when there are more columns than rows in `x`.}
